## Hello, I'm Joel!
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-bergman-498b672b1/">Cybersecurity Professional</a>

I have passion for technology and enjoy working with others. I am adaptable, highly motivated, dedicated to solving complex problems and a detail-oriented person. I am interested in an entry-level cybersecurity position as I believe the Google Cybersecurity Certificate will make me a better candidate and will help develop the required professional skills. I only have lab-based experience on this subject.

## Objective

I am enthusiastic about information security and will positively apply the knowledge to mitigate potential risks, threats, and vulnerabilities As a cybersecurity analyst I will uphold high ethical standards, adhering to the law and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets, to help safeguard organizations and people alike. My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
